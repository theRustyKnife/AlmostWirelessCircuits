#Description#
**This mod adds a pole (AKA Almost an antenna) with very long wire distance but can only carry circuit wires, not copper.**

-------------

After you place the pole, it removes all copper cables connected to it and connects all relevant 'antennas' with red and green wires. If you try to connect copper cables to it manually, they will be removed too.

There will probably be a good amount of lag when placing the pole. That's because the game is not meant to support poles with such wire distance. Other than that, there should be no other slowdown caused by this mod.
